# child_pneumonia_kaggle
Using knn, Nearest Centroid and SVM classifiers, the problem preserved https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/pediatric-pneumonia-chest-xray is tackled in its binary form (where class imbalance is also present). The project includes trying to solve the problem with a simple image vectorisation, using SIFT features in a Bag of Visual words model, and also using the wavelet scattering transform (using the kymatio pagkace).\
By randomised subsampling on the prevalent class and the wavelet scattering transform, an accuracy of 85.3% was achieved (with an 93% recall on the pneumonia class) and with more conservative subsampling techniques recall close to 100% can be achieved (although with accuracy close to 80%), using the RBF SVM. The hyperparameters are not yet optimised and there is still room for improvement.
